# Secret-Manager
A web app built with Node.js and Express that allows users to interact with a remote Secrets API for managing secret data. The app provides a web interface with forms to perform CRUD operations on secret entries via various HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE) using Axios for API requests and EJS for rendering the responses dynamically.
